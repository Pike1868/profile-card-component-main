## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

Still getting comfortable with the whole process of completing these challenges. This challenge helped me practice html and css, adn also needed practice working with css links and images and how to properly use them for github pages. Although it did take me some time to read and research different css properties I'm learning where to look and how to debug quicker than before. Getting more comfortable with html css and using git and vscode.


### Continued development

I wanted to complete the project using tailwind but found that I was facing a lot of issues getting tailwind to work how I intended so I reverted back to just css. Once I started over with just css I was able to figure out how to better structure my html and css. Still had to refresh myself with grid and flexbox to solve this challenge as well. I hope to get better at writing markdown and hope to keep improving overall through these challenges.

### Useful resources
